The lore:
Your brain was wired up onto a machine after your death. The other people what was behind this was researching if a human brain can be completely in a computer world. But no one knows about this. Even the player you does not know about this and they probably think they are in a dream. But the problem with this setup is that it is very illegal as, bugs in the program or game can be extremely fatal to the brain. They get you to test bunch of demoes but because they can't get the top high end coders to code the game, they had to go for different skill level coders that would keep the secret. [UNKNOWN] amount of people has been killed in the operation due to these bugs. Mostly because they end up wondering out of the demo level. To make it even worse, it is really really really to end the task to the human brain as once it awake, it might never sleep unless something kills it. As you the player keeps on going, you can know something is very off. But you can't remember your past, even who you are.
